# Stores REST Api

This is built with Flask, Flask-RESTful, Flask-JWT, and Flask-SQLAlchemy.

Deployed on Heroku.

This app allows users to sign up and be authenticated to view/alter store items
in a database(sqlite/Postgres).  It allows new stores to be created and allows
for items/stores to be added, viewed, edited(items only), and removed (CRUD).
